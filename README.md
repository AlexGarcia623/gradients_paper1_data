# Data associated with "Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations I"

This github repo contains all *data* from the publication: [Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations I: Tension Between Smooth Stellar Feedback Models and Observations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250303804G/abstract)

We note that this github repo contains only the data required to recreate each of Figures 2-9**. To recreate the reduced data products (and figures) completely, we refer you to [scripts and data generation repo]()


**There is no Figure 8 directory because the data required to create Figure 8 exists in Figure 3
